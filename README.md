# rheascript
a script making rhea input files form your fileexplorer


# Idea
In order to use Rhea you need to remultiplex your fastaq files. Rhea provides a perlscript with this capability for you, but it needs a .tab / tab formated file including the filenames needed to do so. This script automatizes the process of making this file.
