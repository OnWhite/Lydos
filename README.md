# Lydos
A script making Rhea input files form your file explorer


# Idea
In order to use Rhea you need to remultiplex your fastq files.
Rhea provides a perlscript with this capability for you, but it
needs a .tab file including the filenames needed 
to do so. This script automatizes the process of making this file.


# Usage
